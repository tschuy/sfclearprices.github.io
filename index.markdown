Hi! We're some everyday San Franciscans interested in transparent restaurant pricing. We just introduced an initiative ordinance, the Transparent Restaurant Pricing Act, for San Francisco to require restaurants to include surcharges in prices. This will be relevant in the event that [SB 1524](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/restaurant-junk-fees-exemption-bill-19497214.php) becomes law.

<details>
<summary>What do you mean by surcharges? Why should we ban them?</summary>
Surcharges are the extra fees you pay atop the prices listed in the menu that show up on your bill at the end of your meal, like a 4.5% "SF Surcharge" or a surprise 10% dine-in fee. Surcharges do <i>not</i> include service charges or "autograt" that take the place of tipping. Mandatory surcharges are fundamentally misleading: they make prices look lower than they actually are, and make you do a multiplication problem to find out what you need to pay.

<summary>Why now?</summary>
In October 2023, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB478">Consumers Legal Remedies Act (SB 478)</a> was signed into law. This banned "drip pricing" (a rising trend in which companies will shift some cost from the price of items into mandatory fees) in California, effective July 1, 2024. But then, in June 2024 — less than a month before the surcharge ban was set to take effect — legislators introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1524">SB 1524</a>, a last-minute attempt to carve out an exception for restaurants and bars to continue to engage in drip pricing. This initiative is intended to close the SB 1524 loophole within San Francisco.

<summary>What evil political monolith PAC is funding this?</summary>

<details>
<summary>Will this raise prices?</summary>
This will require prices include fees we are <i>already paying</i>. The price you see on the menu might go up, but without the added fees, the prices we'll pay at the end of the night stay virtually the same.

<details>
<summary>Will this lower prices? If so, will these cuts hurt workers? </summary>
No. This does not affect the business constraints in which restaurants operate: they still will be required to provide identical benefits to their workers, and can still set prices as needed.

<details>
<summary>I like knowing that my money is supporting workers. Can businesses still include this information?</summary>
Yes. This ordinance only affects the advertised or listed prices of items. If the restaurant wants to put this information on the receipt, they are still free to do so. Consider an example: a current bill may be formatted as

<ul>
<li>$100 food items</li>
<li>$5 SF Mandate Surcharge</li>
<li>Subtotal: $105</li>
<li>Taxes: $9.06</li>
<li>Total: $114.06</li>
</ul>

This bill could equivalently be formatted:

<ul>
<li>$105 food items</li>
<li>Subtotal: $105</li>
<li>Taxes: $9.06</li>
<li>Total: $114.06</li>
<li><i>Note</i>: $5 from your bill went towards our employees' health insurance (for example). Thank you!</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I help?</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="/subscribe">Join our email list.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/">Contact your state legislators</a> and tell them that you oppose SB 1524.</li>
<li><a href="https://sfplanninggis.org/sffind/">Contact your Supervisor</a> and tell them that you support a city ordinance to ban restaurant surcharges.</li>
</ul>

The petition to put this on the ballot has been submitted to the City Attorney for review but is not yet cleared for circulation. (And with any luck, SB 1524 will not pass and this will be unnecessary anyway.)
